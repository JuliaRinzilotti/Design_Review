                <p class="p1">We will review your designs (website or mobile/web app) and explore where the design works
                    well and
                    where
                    it can be improved. We focus our process around one central question: “What can we do to make this
                    design more efficient?”</p>

                <p class="p4"> Unlike any other design review or audit, we will not only tell you what can be improved
                    but also make revamps to the
                    most critical parts of the design.</p>
                <h4>Design Report</h4>
                <p class="p4">
                    We will evaluate your design based on a variety of parameters and provide a detailed visual report
                    with useful tips and design hacks. This would be the starting point for further work on the design.
                </p>
                <h4>Ways to Redesign</h4>
                <p class="p4">We provide several strategies for further redesign by various contractors, from
                    freelancers to high-end agencies. We provide you with an assessment of the timing and cost for both
                    a full redesign and quick but effective improvements.</p>
